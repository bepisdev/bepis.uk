## Smaller Programming Projects

### Copy

A re-implementation of the GNU `cp` command in Go that adds progress reporting, written to perform large file transfers on my NAS when I learned
running `cp -R` on _10tb_ of data from one HDD to another over an SSH connection meant I was unable to tell if the process had hung or not.

### Protorec

Written during my time as an electronics technician working on medical assistance alarms and nurse call systems. Protorec acts as mock
reciever endpoint for various reporting protocols these devices use to send alerts like SIA-CID, and MQTT. Used to test these devices during repair and provisioning.
